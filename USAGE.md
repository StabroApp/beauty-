## Troubleshooting

### "No clinic data found"

**Problem:** The advisor can't find any clinic data.

**Solution:** Run the scraper first:
```bash
python scraper/hotpepper_scraper.py --location tokyo --category salon
```

### "OPENAI_API_KEY not found"

**Problem:** The system can't find your OpenAI API key.

**Solution:** This is just a warning. The system will work in fallback mode without AI features. To enable full AI features:
1. Get an API key from https://platform.openai.com/
2. Create a `.env` file with `OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here`

### "ModuleNotFoundError"

**Problem:** Required Python packages are not installed.

**Solution:** Install the dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

For optional features:
```bash
# For AI features
pip install langchain langchain-openai openai chromadb

# For translation
pip install deep-translator
```

### Search Returns No Results

**Problem:** Searching for clinics returns no results.

**Solution:** 
1. Make sure you've scraped data for that location/category
2. Try broader search terms
3. Use `/stats` to see what data is available

### Cannot Connect to OpenAI

**Problem:** Error connecting to OpenAI API.

**Solution:**
1. Check your API key is correct
2. Ensure you have internet connectivity
3. Verify your OpenAI account has credits
4. The system will automatically fall back to basic mode if OpenAI is unavailable

## Tips and Best Practices

1. **Start with the Demo**: Run `python demo.py` first to understand all features
2. **Scrape Multiple Locations**: Build a comprehensive database by scraping multiple locations and categories
3. **Use Natural Language**: The AI understands natural questions better than keyword searches
4. **Check Stats Regularly**: Use `/stats` to understand what data you have
5. **Update Data**: Re-run the scraper periodically to get fresh data
